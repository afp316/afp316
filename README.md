- 👋 Hi, I’m @afp316
- 👀 I’m interested in engineering, 3D printing, mechatronics, and generally all tinkering.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning a bit about machine learning and AI and trying to get a better (yet still basic) understanding of programming languages.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that can better my understanding of the the programming behind what makes complex mechantronic machines work.  I really enjoy the mentality behind open-source collaboration...there are so many smart and skilled people in this world and collaboration is the most exciting part.
